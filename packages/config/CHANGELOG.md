# @eslit/config

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Rewritten most of the package logic, so now it uses a more standard ESLint configuration object structure. All configurations now are separated in scope and presets are created for better convenience when configuring ESLint. ([#8](https://github.com/LoredDev/ESLit/pull/8))
  (fixes [#3](https://github.com/loreddev/eslit/issues/3)).
